The solution is to ensure that unit types used in calculations are consistent.  Avoid mixing percentages with fixed units (like `px`, `em`, or `rem`) without clearly understanding the context.  If using percentages, ensure the parent container's dimensions are predictable.  For reliable calculations, using only fixed units or only percentages within the `calc()` function is generally recommended.

Here's the corrected code:

```css
/*Using only percentages*/
.container {
  width: 70%;
}

/*Using only fixed units (px)*/
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50px);
}

/*Or using a more predictable calculation, where parent width is known*/
.parent {
  width: 500px;
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}

```

This revised approach ensures accuracy and predictability in the calculations performed by the `calc()` function.
