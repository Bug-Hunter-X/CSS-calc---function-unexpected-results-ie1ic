The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, using it with percentages can sometimes lead to unexpected results. For example, the following code might not produce the intended layout:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

The `calc()` function will calculate 50% of the container's parent element width and add 20px. If the parent element's width is not known, the calculation might not be accurate. 

Another issue is with using units inconsistently within the `calc()` function. For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%);
}
```

This will result in an error. You should use consistent units throughout the calculations.
